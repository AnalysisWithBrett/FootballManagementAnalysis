# Football Manager Squad Optimization Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the readme file for my Football Manager squad optimization project! This personal endeavor delved into the world of football management within the Football Manager game, with a specific focus on optimizing squad selection based on player performance metrics.

## Project Details

### Data Gathering and Analysis

The project began with the gathering and analysis of player data within the Football Manager game. Key metrics such as appearances, goals, assists, and game ratings were collected and meticulously stored in Microsoft Excel. To enhance data quality and usability, SQL was employed for data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation. Tasks included:

- Cleaning and manipulation of player data using SQL.
- Performing data transformations to derive additional insights.
- Joining tables to create a well-structured dataset conducive to analysis.

### Visualization with Tableau

In the final stage of the project, Tableau was utilized to create a captivating narrative around player performance. The resulting Tableau story served as an interactive and visually compelling presentation tool, highlighting the nuances of each player's contributions. By providing a distinct storyline for each player, this innovative approach streamlined data-driven decision-making in the strategic selection of squad members.

## Project Impact

This project underscores the potential of data analytics in enhancing decision-making processes within football management simulations. By leveraging data from the Football Manager game and employing SQL and Tableau, I facilitated the identification of key performance indicators and streamlined squad selection processes. This approach not only enhances the gaming experience but also offers insights applicable to real-world football management scenarios.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this Football Manager squad optimization project demonstrates the synergy between data analytics and gaming simulations. By gathering, analyzing, and visualizing player performance data, I created a framework for strategic squad selection based on objective metrics. As the project concludes, I anticipate further exploration of data-driven strategies in football management simulations, paving the way for enhanced gameplay experiences and actionable insights.

Thank you for exploring this readme file, and I look forward to future discussions on the intersections of data analytics and gaming.
